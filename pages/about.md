I am a Microsoft certified professional with Power BI and PowerApps, as well as a Masters degree in Computer Science. 

I have strong technical skills in using Power Query, Data Modeling, DAX, T-SQL, and Power Automate to perform ETL, design databases, create reports and dashboards, and automate workflows. I also have experience creating business apps using Canvas and Model driven PowerApps. 

I am passionate about learning new technologies and applying them to solve real-world problems and deliver value to the organization and its customers.
